关于我的个人介绍,还没想好怎么写.

## Research
1. **Stochstics Partial differential equations**  <!---<br/>  <font size = "-1"> </font>  
    Recently I've been working on problems related to portfolio optimization with taxes as well as scenario analysis in risk managment. I've also done some work on derivatives pricing (American, swing and leveraged ETF options) and dynamic portfolio optimization.--->   


My research papers can be found [here](/publications).

## Teaching
主要分两部分, 一部分是[中文授课](/teaching), 另一部分是[英文授课](/teaching).

In 2013 I was also awarded the Columbia Engineering School Alumni Association’s Distinguished Faculty Teaching Award for excellence in teaching. In 2019 I received the TEaching Excellence Award for Core Module MBA teaching.
